ðŸ‘‹ Hi,

I'm an IT Professional with a deep interest in software testing and automation.

I have obtained the ISTQB CTFL certificate and I'm keen on learning more. I'm currently working as a Freelance QA Tester and have experience working with and troubleshooting various browser-based apps and services. I have created several testing projects stored in my GitHub repo which covered API Testing, regression testing, unit and full-fledged Test Suits on local sites. I intend to further add to this repo as I learn and improve my knowledge in the field. 

KindÂ regards

Peace.
